        A group of young people founded an organisation that operates in the
        fields of agriculture and urban planning located in Mathibela, Limpopo.
        Through their non-governmental organisation aptly called, Harvest they
        have embarked on a journey of establishing a community garden at
        Mathibela village in Limpopo. They have secured space in Sekutupu
        primary school and Mabolepu secondary school. They have also joined
        hands with elderly women in their community that volunteered to help
        with preparing the soil.
      </p>
      <p>
        Director of the organisation, Mr Lesetja Mokonyama said "We would like
        to express our deepest gratitude for your unselfish contribution towards
        the initiatives of Harvest. Donations from people like you help us in
        continuing our mission to help the poor and underprivileged to get food
        and therapy. Your financial support will enable us to bring some solace
        to the underprivileged in our locality which in turn will help in
        combating crime and drug abuse. Equally, it will aid in the sustenance
        and continuity of our commitment to serve our community, and in
        cultivating the young minds for the world’s endless possibilities. Thank
        you once more as your generous donation is important to us, as we become
        the change-makers for every child because every child deserves a fair
        chance."
      </p>
      <p>
        Head of Community Support at Cashbuild, Mr Thembelani Tukwayo fulsome of
        praise for the work of these youngsters. “This is great initiative by
        Harvest. Unemployment rate in our country is at its highest level, and
        initiatives like this helps our youth earn and sustain a living for them
        and their families.” The garden tools donated are Garden Forks, Hand
        Trowel, Hand Fork and other similar tools. The donation includes two
        Water Tanks. The community garden will produce onions and spinach,
        avocados and tomatoes.
