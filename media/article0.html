                <em>South Africa</em> has been <strong>plagued</strong> by energy challenges and the burden has increased over the past half a decade.
                Being a coal-based economy, South Africa has a responsibility to significantly reduce their <span class="responsive">carbon footprint</span>
                to fulfil the sustainability development goals.
                <br>
                South African cities are today vulnerable to disinvestments, unreliable and inefficient due to their overconsumption of non-renewable energy; <br>

                which consequently has resulted in continuous blackouts and/or loadshedding. <br>
               <br>
                In order to curb the exponential increase of fossil fuel emissions, climate anthropogenic factors need to be reduced,
                through lowering the energy costs and improving the reliability through using green-infrastructure and renewable energy.
                Such initiatives would see an increase in renewable energy providers investing in wind farms; hydroelectric plants;
                and solar energy farms. <br>
                <br>
                During the 27th conference of the parties (COP27) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, on the
                20th of November 2022, the South African President, honourable Cyril Matamela Ramaphosa placed the Republic on a pedestal as 
                the Green Hydrogen destination, termed the ‘new gold rush’. The Green Hydrogen opportunity is based on the country’s size and 
                climate. These geographical indicators empower South Africa with impeccable solar radiation and wind energy loads coupled with 
                the significant land abundance in close proximity to water parcels.
