                <em>South Africa</em> has been <strong>plagued</strong> by energy challenges and the burden has increased over the past half a decade. <br>
                Being a coal-based economy,South Africa has a responsibility to significantly reduce their <span class="responsive">carbon footprint</span> <br>

                South African cities are today vulnerable to disinvestments, unreliable and inefficient due to their overconsumption of non-renewable energy; <br>

                In order to curb the exponential increase of fossil fuel emissions, climate anthropogenic factors need to be reduced,<br>
                through lowering the energy costs and improving the reliability through using green-infrastructure and renewable energy. <br>
                Such initiatives would see an increase in renewable energy providers investing in wind farms; hydroelectric plants; <br>
                and solar energy farms.
