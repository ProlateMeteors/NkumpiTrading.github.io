			      <h1>Reducing Fossil Fuel Emissions through Renewable Energy</h1>
			      <h2>SA's exponential increase of fossil fuel emissions</h2>

			      <p>
				South Africa has been plagued by energy challenges and the burden has
				increased over the past half a decade. Being a coal-based economy, South
				Africa has a responsibility to significantly reduce their carbon
				footprint to fulfil the sustainability development goals.
			      </p>
			      <p>
				South African cities are today vulnerable to disinvestments, unreliable
				and inefficient due to their overconsumption of non-renewable energy;
			      </p>
			      <ul>
				<li>Lack of infrastructure maintenance</li>
				<li>
				  <a
				    href="https://www.ifri.org/en/publications/editoriaux-de-lifri/edito-energie/south-africas-energy-policies-are-changes-finally"
				    >Uncertain energy policies</a
				  >
				</li>
				<li>lacklustre leadership</li>
			      </ul>
			      <p>
				which consequently has resulted in continuous blackouts and/or
				loadshedding.
			      </p>
			      <p>
				In order to curb the exponential increase of fossil fuel emissions,
				climate anthropogenic factors need to be reduced, through lowering the
				energy costs and improving the reliability through using
				green-infrastructure and renewable energy. Such initiatives would see an
				increase in renewable energy providers investing in wind farms;
				hydroelectric plants; and solar energy farms.
			      </p>
			      <p>
				During the 27th conference of the parties (COP27) to the United Nations
				Framework Convention on Climate Change, on the 20th of November 2022,
				the South African President, honourable Cyril Matamela Ramaphosa placed
				the Republic on a pedestal as the Green Hydrogen destination, termed the
				'new gold rush'. The Green Hydrogen opportunity is based on the
				country's size and climate. These geographical indicators empower South
				Africa with impeccable solar radiation and wind energy loads coupled
				with the significant land abundance in close proximity to water parcels.
			      </p>
			      <p>
				The production of hydrogen fuel through the process of solar or
				wind-powered electrolysis is known as green hydrogen and has become a
				talking point in the industrial and decarbonising of the economy. In
				addition, the South African government has set aside R300 Billion for
				their proposed 19 projects that are said to kick-start as soon as the
				Green Hydrogen National Program (GHNP) has been gazetted.
			      </p>
			      <p>
				The ambiguity in the hydrogen-energy fallacy is that, over the past
				decade the South African government has invested billions of rands into
				the construction of two power stations namely MEDUPE and KUSILE. The
				power stations were said to be the biggest in SA. Indeed, the former has
				been the biggest flop post-1994, due to discussions of Eskom's rescue
				plans in the past budget speeches. This comes on the backdrop that, the
				utilities construction is not yet complete and are not fully
				operational. The 6x800 MW stations were set to alleviate the energy
				crises within South Africa and produce enough energy into the grid,
				which will significantly bring an end to the staggering rolling
				blackouts which have awfully plunged the economy of the country.
			      </p>
			      <p>
				It is suggested that green and future cities are built on the bedrock of
				green economies such as that envisioned by city planners and law-makers.
				This can be achieved through influencing legislation and regulation
				relating to urban form, energy efficiency standards, public transport,
				and energy distribution and tariffs.
