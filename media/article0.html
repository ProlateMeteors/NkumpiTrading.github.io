				<h1>Reducing Fossil Fuel Emissions through Renewable Energy</h1>
				<h2>SA's exponential increase of fossil fuel emissions</h2>
				<img
				  src="../images/article0.jpg"
				  alt="Renewable energy sources"
				/>
				<p class="published-by">Published by NkumpiTrading, 01 Feb 2023</p>
				<p>
				  South Africa has been plagued by energy challenges and the burden has
				  increased over the past half a decade. Being a coal-based economy, South
				  Africa has a responsibility to significantly reduce their carbon
				  footprint to fulfil the sustainability development goals.
				</p>
				<p>
				  South African cities are today vulnerable to disinvestments, unreliable
				  and inefficient due to their overconsumption of non-renewable energy;
				</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Lack of infrastructure maintenance</li>
				  <li><a href="#myfirst">Uncertain energy policies</a></li>
				  <li>lacklustre leadership</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
				  which consequently has resulted in continuous blackouts and/or
				  loadshedding.
				</p>
				<p>
				  In order to curb the exponential increase of fossil fuel emissions,
				  climate anthropogenic factors need to be reduced, through lowering the
				  energy costs and improving the reliability through using
				  green-infrastructure and renewable energy. Such initiatives would see an
				  increase in renewable energy providers investing in wind farms;
				  hydroelectric plants; and solar energy farms.
				</p>
				<p>
				  During the 27th conference of the parties (COP27) to the United Nations
				  Framework Convention on Climate Change, on the 20th of November 2022,
				  the South African President, honourable Cyril Matamela Ramaphosa placed
				  the Republic on a pedestal as the Green Hydrogen destination, termed the
				  'new gold rush'. The Green Hydrogen opportunity is based on the
				  country’s size and climate. These geographical indicators empower South
				  Africa with impeccable solar radiation and wind energy loads coupled
				  with the significant land abundance in close proximity to water parcels.
				</p>
				<p>
				  The production of hydrogen fuel through the process of solar or
				  wind-powered electrolysis is known as green hydrogen and has become a
				  talking point in the industrial and decarbonising of the economy. In
				  addition, the South African government has set aside R300Billion for
				  their proposed 19 projects that are said to kick-start as soon as the
				  Green Hydrogen National Program (GHNP) has been gazetted.
				</p>
				<p>
				  The ambiguity in the hydrogen-energy fallacy is that, over the past
				  decade the South African government has invested billions of rands into
				  the construction of two power stations namely MEDUPE and KUSILE. The
				  power stations were said to be the biggest in SA. Indeed, the former has
				  been the biggest flop post-1994, due to discussions of Eskom’s rescue
				  plans in the past budget speeches. This comes on the backdrop that, the
				  utilities construction is not yet complete and are not fully
				  operational. The 6×800MW stations were set to alleviate the energy
				  crises within South Africa and produce enough energy into the grid,
				  which will significantly bring an end to the staggering rolling
				  blackouts which have awfully plunged the economy of the country.
				</p>
				<p>
				  It is suggested that green and future cities are built on the bedrock of
				  green economies such as that envisioned by city planners and law-makers.
				  This can be achieved through influencing legislation and regulation
				  relating to urban form, energy efficiency standards, public transport,
				  and energy distribution and tariffs.
