                <br><em>South Africa</em> has been <strong>plagued</strong> by energy challenges and the burden has increased over the past half a decade.
                Being a coal-based economy, South Africa has a responsibility to significantly reduce their <span class="responsive">carbon footprint</span>
                to fulfil the sustainability development goals.
                <br>
                South African cities are today vulnerable to disinvestments, unreliable and inefficient due to their overconsumption of non-renewable energy; <br>

                <li>Lack of infrastructure maintenance</li>
                <li><a href="#myfirst">Uncertain energy policies</a></li>

                <br>which consequently has resulted in continuous blackouts and/or loadshedding. <br>
               <br>
                In order to curb the exponential increase of fossil fuel emissions, climate anthropogenic factors need to be reduced,
                through lowering the energy costs and improving the reliability through using green-infrastructure and renewable energy.
                Such initiatives would see an increase in renewable energy providers investing in wind farms; hydroelectric plants;
                and solar energy farms. <br>
                <br>
                During the 27th conference of the parties (COP27) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, on the
                20th of November 2022, the South African President, honourable Cyril Matamela Ramaphosa placed the Republic on a pedestal as 
                the Green Hydrogen destination, termed the ‘new gold rush’. The Green Hydrogen opportunity is based on the country’s size and 
                climate. These geographical indicators empower South Africa with impeccable solar radiation and wind energy loads coupled with 
                the significant land abundance in close proximity to water parcels. <br>
		<br>
		The production of hydrogen fuel through the process of solar or wind-powered electrolysis is known as green hydrogen and has become
		a talking point in the industrial and decarbonising of the economy. In addition, the South African government has set aside R300Billion 
		for their proposed 19 projects that are said to kick-start as soon as the Green Hydrogen National Program (GHNP) has been gazetted. <br>
		<br>
		The ambiguity in the hydrogen-energy fallacy is that, over the past decade the South African government has invested billions of rands 
		into the construction of two power stations namely MEDUPE and KUSILE. The power stations were said to be the biggest in SA. Indeed, 
		the former has been the biggest flop post-1994, due to discussions of Eskom’s rescue plans in the past budget speeches. 
		This comes on the backdrop that, the utilities construction is not yet complete and are not fully operational. The 6×800MW stations were 
		set to alleviate the energy crises within South Africa and produce enough energy into the grid, which will significantly bring an end to 
		the staggering rolling blackouts which have awfully plunged the economy of the country. <br>
		<br>
		It is suggested that green and future cities are built on the bedrock of green economies such as that envisioned by city planners and 
		law-makers. This can be achieved through influencing legislation and regulation relating to urban form, energy efficiency standards, 
		public transport, and energy distribution and tariffs. <br>
