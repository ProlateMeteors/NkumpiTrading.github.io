      <p class="published-by">Published by NkumpiTrading, 01 Mar 2023</p>
      <p>
        Nkumpi Trading are advocates and scholars of economic planning. The stance is solidified by the disaggregated nature 
        of socio-political economics of African cities; townships and rural areas. Knowingly, the lack of economic opportunities 
        and infrastructure that overwhelms townships and rural areas today are as a result of colonialisation and apartheid.
      </p>
      <p>
        In South Africa, apartheid was employed as a tool to divide and rule along ethnic and racial lines. 
        Considerably, the African populace were disempowered educationally and economically, and squeezed into labour reserves 
        i.e. townships. Equivocally, these settings were not designed for economic prosperity but rather for continued oppression and squalor. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As a consequence the post-democratic economic policy programs adopted by the ruling party (African National Congress) are continuously 
        falling short of their intended objectives for townships and rural areas. The aforementioned shortfall is attributed to a number of factors 
        such as lack of land-use planning; top-down macro-economic policies and; lack of decentralisation and devolution etc. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The resultant of these failure is a demonstration of (1) deliberate sabotage to further sink townships and rural areas into catacombs of poverty 
        and/or, (2) incapability of economic planning for African settlements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let us unpack the latter to substantially zero-in on the phrase township economy. For those and many unacquainted with the term, 
        tend to equate it to governments economic policy programs under the disheartening umbrella of local economic development (LED). 
        Local Economic Development (LED) has to do with local development, with specific aims of stimulating the growth of local economy, complete and create jobs, 
        and making better decisions in terms of the utilization of available local resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unashamedly, the policy implementation is unstable and unsure on how to follow through development strategies such as small-medium-micro enterprises (SMME’s) 
        being key drivers to foster sustainable economic development. The underlying phenomenon of LED is embedded in its objectives to increase the tax base of a region, 
        community, and/or a municipality, while having a significant spill-off in job creation. However, there has been a misconception in relation to whether 
        LED promotes economic growth or development, or whether the latter is a consequence of the former?
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, it is essential to unearth whether the land use management systems (LUMS) and small business development models of the west (developed economies) 
        are applicable to transitional and underdeveloped economies of the global south, especially in post-colonial/independent context. 
        As Sihlongonyane (2015) alludes to the issue that contemporary planning of the west has failed to respond to and acknowledge different kinds of space-production.
      </p>
      <p>
        Significantly one needs to examine land use management systems (LUMS), entrepreneurial and institutional determinants of small enterprise development and 
        the interrelationships between institutional factors in the context of a fragmented and/or transitional local government. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Attempts by urban practitioners to bring together insights from spatial planning (LUMS) and local economic development (LED), 
        through exploring the use of small micro enterprise development (SMED) as a local economic development strategy for municipal planning is of paramount importance. 
        This is pivotal as the central concern is trying to find ways of making spatial planning more transformative. 
        Clearly, spatial planning is a major contributory factor to the socio-economic inequalities plaguing SA’s geo-economic landscapes (Todes and Turok, 2017), 
        notably being its impact in terms of inbred poverty and unemployment (Visagie, 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
        In conclusion, I have been struck by some intriguing and apparently unanticipated parallels in the municipal planning and local economic development literature.
        It is in this ‘terrain’ that I wish to locate my area of interest, drawing mainly on three areas of theoretical construct. 
      </p>
      <p>
        These are South African planning theory (1950), (1) aspects of developmental local government view as a transformative and collaborative paradigm; 
        (2) Neo-classical economic theories of development and (3) Alice Amsden late industrialisation (small business development) in the developing world.
